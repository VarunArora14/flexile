        Why\r\n\r\nFor traction, Flexile needs companies to see how much their contractors
        are getting done in an accessible format. We have a strong opinion on this
        and should build it into our product. Will also decrease Slack notifications
        and overall reliance on Slack for a core process that can better live within
        Flexile and be further automated over time.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/flexile/issues/2792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/antiwork/flexile/issues/2792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}'
